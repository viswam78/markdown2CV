# markdown2CV
Motivation from previous open source projects:

https://github.com/elipapa/markdown-cv

https://github.com/blmoore/md-cv

I will use this repo to tweak the layouts folder and the css styles to generate the CV, mostly to take a print and publish as PDF, and at the same time, take advantage of this set-up with gh-pages/jekyll to host the CV!
